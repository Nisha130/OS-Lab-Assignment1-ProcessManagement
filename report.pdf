Title:
Process Creation and Management Using Python OS Module

Objectives:
• Understand process creation and hierarchy.
• Execute system commands using exec().
• Demonstrate zombie and orphan process behavior.
• Explore process details from /proc filesystem.
• Observe effect of priority using nice().

Tools Used:
Python 3.x, Linux OS (os, subprocess modules)

Results & Observations:
• Successfully created multiple child processes.
• Commands executed correctly using execvp.
• Zombie process observed in ps -el as <defunct>.
• Orphan process re-parented to init (PID 1).
• Different nice values showed timing variations.

Conclusion:
All tasks successfully implemented.
This lab enhanced understanding of process management and scheduling in operating systems.
